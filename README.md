# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## How to Start Project:

- Install app dependencies:
```sh
yarn install
```
- Command run or change scripts in package.json 
```sh
yarn dev
```
```sh
yarn dev--host
```
```sh
yarn build
```
```sh
yarn build--base
```
```sh
yarn lint
```
```sh
yarn preview
```
